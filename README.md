/////////////////////////////////////////////////
If your power is down, this scritpt might help...

This Autohotkey scritpt allows you to copy and paste a way more easier and faster, 
as well as other operations.
The main idea is:
You just need to hold a Tab key, never release it, when you are copying anything. 
It should  work perfectly for both - for text, and for files, too.
